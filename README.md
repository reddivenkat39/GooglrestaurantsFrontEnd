# GooglrestaurantsFrontEnd
This is the googlrestaurnts fronend code -[ when some one searches the a area they will be able to see all the restaurants with distances in that area]

1.The first page lets us search for the possible locations for the given name.
2.From the list of destinations that are showed by the use of google API, we can select on target location.
3.The target location coordinates are calculated and passed to the next page where the nearest restaurants are shown as list 
with their distance from the point of search

Future of this App would be , self location detection and finding the restaurants and places of interest within given radius.
Their distances are calculated and from different api services which give ratings as service calculate the ratings and show the list in
orer.
And by recording the action of the user on the application we can make the application intercative to the user. [ that is if a user is searching 
for food daily or weekly for food then the average time of search is calculated and timely popups are given so that the user is 
reminded of his interests and also advertise new in business entites to the user]
